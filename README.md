# Marketplace_Prototype
Welcome to REgen - an ecosystem of a multi-fuel trading market and services relevant to the New Fuel Economy (Hydrogen, Ammonia & Methanol). 

## Introduction
Our mission is to create an inclusive, liquid and transparent future fuel marketplace ecosystem. This prototype is for the fuel trading (primary commodities marketplace) that will exist within our ecosystem of services. The prototype provides a platform for buyers and sellers to trade fuel via an auction system (think eBay/Amazon).
